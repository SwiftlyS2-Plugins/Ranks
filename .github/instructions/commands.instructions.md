# Commands

> Part of the Ranks instruction set. `§N` cross-references resolve through the table in [`copilot-instructions.md`](../copilot-instructions.md), which is always loaded; `docs/` references are to the separate requirements and implementation guides.

### Pattern A: `Core.Command.RegisterCommand()` — how `Ranks` registers

FR-CMD-01 makes the command name, its permission, and whether it registers at
all operator-editable in `commands.jsonc`. **Attribute arguments are
compile-time constants, so `[Command]` cannot express any of that** — least of
all "an empty `Command` string means do not register". Registration is therefore
a loop over bound config in `Load`:

```csharp
foreach (var (key, info) in commands.CurrentValue.All)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(info.Command)) continue;   // operator removed it

    var guid = Core.Command.RegisterCommand(
        info.Command, handlers.For(key), registerRaw: true,
        permission: info.Permission,
        helpText: Core.Localizer[$"command.{key}.help"]);

    registered.Add(guid);

    foreach (var alias in info.Aliases)
        Core.Command.RegisterCommandAlias(info.Command, alias, registerRaw: true);
}
```

`RegisterCommand` returns a `Guid` for `UnregisterCommand`. Help text is
**mandatory** — one short sentence — and comes from `Core.Localizer`, not from
`commands.jsonc`, because it is player-facing (§6). `permission` is checked
before the handler runs, so an admin command needs no in-body check.
`registerRaw: true` keeps the console name equal to the configured one instead
of `sw_<name>`.

### Pattern B: `[Command]` attribute — fixed names only

Correct for any command whose name can never change. **`Ranks` has none**, so
this pattern does not appear in core; a module with hardcoded names may use it.

```csharp
[Command("rank", HelpText = "Shows your current rank, points and progress.")]
[CommandAlias("myrank")]
public void OnRank(ICommandContext context) { }
```

> A `[Command]` outside the `BasePlugin` class needs
> `Core.Registrator.Register(instance)` in `Load`, exactly like
> `[GameEventHandler]` (§7). An unregistered command does not error — it just
> does not exist, and the player sees `Unknown command`.

### Handler — `ICommandContext`

Members are `Sender` (`IPlayer?`), `IsSentByPlayer`, `Prefix`, `IsSlient`
(framework spelling — not `IsSilent`), `CommandName`, `Args`, `Reply` and
`ReplyAsync`. `Sender` is `null` from the server console, so check
`IsSentByPlayer` before dereferencing it.

> **Whether `Args[0]` is the first argument or the command name is not stated
> anywhere in the framework docs.** Confirm it once on a live server and fix the
> indexing everywhere — guessing wrong shifts every argument by one, which
> parses as a usage error rather than a crash. `CommandName` is available
> separately either way, so nothing needs `Args` to carry it.

```csharp
private void OnGivePoints(ICommandContext context)
{
    if (!context.IsSentByPlayer) return;
    var args = context.Args;

    if (args.Length < 2)
    {
        context.Reply("Usage: !givepoints <target> <amount>");
        return;
    }

    if (!int.TryParse(args[1], out var amount))
    {
        context.Reply(Core.Localizer["error.invalid_amount"]);
        return;
    }
}
```

### Permission naming

Format: `<pluginid>.<action>` — lowercase, dot-separated, `snake_case` for
multi-word actions. Each plugin uses **its own id** as the scope, so a module
namespaces under itself rather than under `ranks`.

```csharp
"ranks.admin"                  // core admin commands
"ranks.vip"                    // VIP multiplier flag
"ranks_weaponstats.view"       // owned by the WeaponStats module
```

CounterStrikeSharp-style permissions (`@css/...`) are **forbidden** — they are a
different framework's notation and SwiftlyS2 will not resolve them.

### Responses

```csharp
context.Reply("Message");                                   // back to chat or console
player.SendChat(Core.Localizer["prefix"] + " " + message);  // one player
Core.PlayerManager.SendChat(message);                       // everyone

// From a background thread, marshal first and re-validate
Core.Scheduler.NextTick(() =>
{
    if (player?.Controller is not { IsValid: true }) return;
    player.SendChat(message);
});
```
