# Changelog

Notable changes to Ranks, newest first.

<!-- The release workflow takes the version from the TOP "## [x.y.z]" heading below and
     refuses to publish unless it matches PluginMetadata.Version in
     Ranks/src/Entrypoint.cs.

     This file covers CORE only. Each module keeps its own CHANGELOG.md beside its csproj
     and is versioned independently; a core release attaches the modules as they stand.

     Add the section for 1.0.0 when the plugin is ready to ship. Until then the
     release workflow will refuse to publish, which is intended. Shape:

     ## [1.0.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

     Optional one-line summary.

     - What changed, from the server admin's side.

     See .github/instructions/changelog.instructions.md for the full style. -->

## [1.4.0] - 2026-11-08

- New `Scoreboard.CustomRankStep` spaces Custom-mode tiers through a larger icon set: `10`
  puts them on icons 1, 11, 21 and so on. The default, `1`, counts up one icon per tier
  ([wiki](https://github.com/SwiftlyS2-Plugins/Ranks/wiki/Scoreboard-And-Rank-Icons#custom-mode)).
- Added more translations

## [1.3.1] - 2026-11-08

- Added Finnish translations to core and all modules

## [1.3.0] - 2026-11-07

Playtime, counted the way K4-LevelRanks counted it.

- New `!mytime` shows your playtime in chat, and `!ttop` opens a playtime leaderboard.
- `!stats` and the Leaderboard menu show playtime too.
- The first boot adds a `playtime` column to the player tables. Without schema-change
  rights, add it by hand first: see the
  [wiki](https://github.com/SwiftlyS2-Plugins/Ranks/wiki/Database#without-schema-change-rights).
- Playtime starts at 0 for everyone. Ranks_Importer 1.1.0 can import it from your old
  plugin, even onto a server already running Ranks.
- Plugins can read playtime through `core.playtime` and `RanksPlayerSnapshot.Playtime`.
- If you run your own translation file, add `playtime.*`, `duration.*`, `menu.toptime.*`,
  `menu.*.playtime`, and the `help` and `command` keys for `mytime` and `ttop`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-11-07

Worth updating if you run MySQL or MariaDB, or want seasons that follow the calendar month.
Includes the work versioned 1.1.1, which was never released on its own.

- On MySQL/MariaDB, players whose names contain emoji or special letters (such as 𝓩) lost
  their progress at every restart (`skipped <SteamID> in this save pass` in the log).
  Progress already lost cannot be recovered.
- With `Database.TablePrefix` or `TableSuffix` set, the migration ledgers carried it twice,
  such as `awp_awp_ranks_migrations`. The first boot renames them.
- The first boot also converts the `name` columns to `utf8mb4`, which can take a while on a
  large database, so update with a restart rather than a hot reload. Without schema-change
  rights, apply both changes by hand first: see the
  [wiki](https://github.com/SwiftlyS2-Plugins/Ranks/wiki/Database#without-schema-change-rights).
- On PostgreSQL, a second install with its own prefix or suffix in the same database no
  longer fails with `relation "PK_ranks_players" already exists`.
- The false `Plugin 'Ranks' uses obsolete API: ...NextTickAsync` warning at load is gone.
- New `Database.VirtualPurgeMode`: set it to `1` for a new season at 00:00 UTC on the 1st of
  every month. The default, `0`, leaves seasons off unless `VirtualPurgeDays` is set.
- Switching to `1` never cuts the running season short. Keep `VirtualPurgeDays` at its old
  value until that season ends.
- Every server sharing a database needs the same season settings. One that falls behind now
  joins the newer season instead of resetting its players into the old one.
- **Previous seasons** names a season that ran exactly one calendar month by its month, such
  as "November 2026".
- The Leaderboard's season line now sits under the title and is no longer cut off.
- Update Ranks_WeaponStats and Ranks_CustomCombos to 1.1.1 with this release, so their
  season lists match.
- If you run your own translation file, add `menu.period.month`,
  `menu.period.current_month`, `menu.period.last_day` and `month.1` to `month.12`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-06

Seasons: optional automatic resets that keep every past season and an all-time board
([#2](https://github.com/SwiftlyS2-Plugins/Ranks/issues/2)).

- New `Database.VirtualPurgeDays` in `config.jsonc`, `0` (off) by default. Set it to `30` and
  every 30 days everyone's rank and statistics start over at `Rank.StartPoints`. Nothing is
  deleted: each finished season is kept, and players are told in chat when a new one starts.
- `!top` and `!stats` gain "This season", "All time" and "Previous seasons" while seasons are
  on. The all-time board ranks players as if no season had ever reset them.
- The first boot adds a `period` column to `ranks_players` and creates `ranks_players_history`.
  On a host that does not allow schema changes, apply them by hand before upgrading: a missing
  column is now reported once at boot, and nothing is recorded, instead of every player load failing.
- Turning seasons on starts the first one immediately; everything recorded before it appears
  as "Before seasons". Every server sharing one database must use the same value, and a
  changed value takes effect at its next season boundary.
- `!resetrank` and `!resetmyrank` now tell modules about the reset, so update all modules with
  this release: weapon stats, combo counts and Elo ratings are cleared with the rank instead of
  surviving it. Past seasons are not touched by a reset.
- `GetPositionAsync` returns `0` for a player with no figures instead of ranking them first.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-11-04

- New read-only API members for menu renderers and other plugins: the ladder (`GetLadder`),
  the scoreboard's rank icon for any point total (`GetRankIcon`), and any player's statistics
  whether online or not (`LoadSnapshotAsync`). Snapshots now also carry headshots, hits and
  misses. CustomHUD draws the `!rank` pages from these, so update it along with Ranks.
- Aliases in `commands.jsonc` and `Vip.Flags` in `config.jsonc` now replace the shipped ones
  instead of adding to them: changing `myrank` used to keep `!myrank` registered, and replacing
  `@ranks/vip` still granted VIP to it. Check both files if you edited either list.
- Includes `Ranks_WeaponStats` 1.0.2, which fixes the same alias problem for `!ws`.
- `!setpoints`, `!givepoints`, `!removepoints` and `!resetrank` now find their target: every
  correctly typed command was answered with a usage message. The target is a name, a SteamID
  or the player's id from `status`, and can be someone spectating or still picking a team.
- A partial name that matches several players is refused instead of changing all of them.
  Type more of the name, or use the SteamID or `status` id.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-11-04

- Fixed Ranks breaking other plugins that use FluentMigrator, such as VIPCore. After
  updating, delete `FluentMigrator*.dll` from `Ranks/resources/exports/` and update all
  Ranks modules.
- Statistics now stop whenever points do: below `Rank.MinPlayers`, during warmup with
  `Rank.WarmupPoints` off, and against bots with `Rank.BotsEnabled` off. A drawn round no
  longer counts as a loss.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-11-01

- Use event-driven update frequency for Scoreboard rank instead of OnTick. This improves performance a lot.
- Improved lazy player data loading

## [1.0.2] - 2026-10-30

- Now everyone can see everyone's rank by default without any additional modules required.
- Added `Scoreboard.Reveal` to `config.jsonc` to control when that reveal is re-sent —
  `OnRoundStart`, `OnPlayerJoin`, `OnRankChange` and `JoinDelaySeconds`, all on by default.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-29

- Fixed `RankMode` modes to have 4 modes instead of 5 (5-th one was DangerZone which is not present in CS2)
- Removed `Mode` config option. It was being used as a fallback for `RankMode` (leftover thing from POC version)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-29

- Fixed modules depenency loading when publishing the plugin

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-29

- Initial release
