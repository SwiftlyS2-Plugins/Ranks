## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-26

First release. Operator-defined kill combinations, awarded on top of core's flat catalogue
or in place of it.

- Combine kill attributes into named combos with their own point value, configured in one
  block per combo.
- Vocabulary covers the raw `player_death` flags, valued attributes (`distance:`,
  `hitgroup:`, `weapon:`) and derived ones (`weapon_class:`, `first_blood`). The README
  lists every name.
- `Count` awards same-tick multi-kills, such as one grenade killing three players.
- `SuppressCoreAwards` makes a matched combo the whole award for that kill instead of a
  bonus on top.
- Where several combos match, the most specific one pays — ties resolve by config order.
- Per-combo counters in a paged menu, opened with `!combos` (alias `!mycombos`) or from
  core's `!rank` → Statistics, and readable through the published
  `Ranks.CustomCombos.Api.v1`.
- Ships no combos by default; `resources/examples/combos.jsonc` has a starting set.
