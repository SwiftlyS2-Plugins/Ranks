# Ranks_CustomCombos — features

Operator-defined kill combinations. Core prices each kill attribute separately and stacks
them; this module prices the **combination**, and can optionally take the kill over.

> Specified by [FR-MOD-06](../../../docs/functional-requirements.md). This document
> follows it except where §8 records a deviation.

## 1. What a combo is

A named match plus a point value, declared in the module's own config:

```jsonc
"Combos": {
  "noscope_hs": {
    "RequiresAll": [ "headshot", "noscope" ],
    "Points": 10
  },

  "nade_triple": {
    "RequiresAll": [ "weapon_class:grenade" ],
    "Count": 3,
    "Points": 100
  },

  "clean_knife": {
    "RequiresAll": [ "weapon_class:knife" ],
    "RequiresNone": [ "attackerblind" ],
    "Points": 50
  }
}
```

The config key is the combo's identity: it becomes the award reason `combo.noscope_hs`,
the translation key, and the database row key. Renaming a key starts a new counter.

The module ships **no combos by default** (FR-MOD-06). The vocabulary exists so servers
can build their own; shipping opinionated combinations is a balance decision that belongs
to the operator.

---

## 2. The attribute vocabulary

Combos are custom; attributes are not. Every kill produces an attribute set, and a combo
can only test what is in it.

### 2.1 Raw event flags

The attribute name **is** the `player_death` field name — one canonical spelling, and an
operator can confirm it against an event dump rather than against our documentation.

| Attribute | True when |
|---|---|
| `headshot` | `Headshot` |
| `noscope` | `NoScope` |
| `thrusmoke` | `ThruSmoke` |
| `attackerblind` | `AttackerBlind` |
| `attackerinair` | `AttackerInAir` |
| `assistedflash` | `AssistedFlash` |
| `penetrated` | `Penetrated > 0` — the field is a count, not a flag |
| `dominated` | `Dominated > 0` |
| `revenge` | `Revenge > 0` |

Four of these — `attackerinair`, `assistedflash`, `dominated`, `revenge` — are things
**core does not price at all**. A single-attribute combo is therefore legitimate and must
not be rejected as redundant; it is the only way to score them.

### 2.2 Parameterised attributes

Fields that carry a value rather than a flag take an argument after a colon:

| Attribute | Matches |
|---|---|
| `hitgroup:<n>` | `ActualHitGroup == n` |
| `weapon:<classname>` | `Weapon == classname`, e.g. `weapon:weapon_ak47` |
| `distance:<units>` | `Distance >= units`, e.g. `distance:2000` |

`distance:<units>` replaces FR-MOD-06's `long_distance` plus a module-level
`LongDistanceUnits` setting. One combo wanting 2000 and another wanting 4000 is a normal
thing to express, and a single module-wide threshold cannot. It also means this module
needs no distance configuration of its own.

### 2.3 Derived attributes

No raw field exists, so these are computed and named for what they mean:

| Attribute | True when |
|---|---|
| `weapon_class:<class>` | `knife` / `grenade` / `inferno` / `taser` / `pistol` / `smg` / `rifle` / `sniper` / `shotgun` / `heavy` |
| `team_kill` | attacker and victim on the same team |
| `suicide` | no attacker, or attacker is the victim |
| `first_blood` | first kill of the round, tracked by the module |

`weapon_class` is **the module's own mapping, not core's.** Core classifies only five
weapon kinds because those are the five it prices; the ten here exist so a combo can say
"any sniper".

### 2.4 Absent on purpose

There is deliberately **no `victim_blind` or `crouched`** (FR-MOD-06): `EventPlayerDeath`
carries neither, and both would need victim pawn state read at death — a separate and
racier mechanism. Add them only with an explicit decision about where the read happens.

---

## 3. Matching

```csharp
RanksKillMatch {
    string[] RequiresAll;    // every attribute must be present
    string[] RequiresNone;   // none of these may be present
    int      Count;          // 1 = a single kill; N = N kills on the same tick
}
```

Matching is declarative rather than a predicate so a combo is expressible in config at all.

### 3.1 Count is same-tick only

`Count: 3` means three matching kills **from the same tick** — one grenade detonation
killing three players. It is not a killstreak.

Streaks and spread-over-time multi-kills are **core's**, which already owns eleven streak
tiers and `Points.SecondsBetweenKills`. This module never competes with that; a combo that
wanted "three kills in five seconds" is a core streak, not a combo.

> This drops FR-MOD-06's `Within` field. With same-tick as the only window, `Within` has
> exactly one legal value and a config field whose only valid setting is `0` is noise.

### 3.2 Closest match wins

A combo matches when `RequiresAll` is a subset of the kill's attributes and no
`RequiresNone` attribute is present. Several can match at once; **only one pays** — the one
with the most `RequiresAll` entries.

Given a no-scope wallbang headshot and

| Combo | RequiresAll | Points |
|---|---|---|
| `noscope_hs` | headshot, noscope | 10 |
| `noscope_hs_wb` | headshot, noscope, penetrated | 25 |

the award is **25, not 35**. Operators write combos as escalating tiers, and paying every
match compounds them into numbers nobody configured.

Ties between equally specific combos resolve by **config order**, first wins. Resolving by
value would let an operator reorder behaviour by editing a number.

### 3.3 Validation at load

Reported once at load with the offending combo named, and the combo skipped — a rule that
silently never matches is indistinguishable from one that is merely hard to trigger:

- an unknown attribute, or a malformed parameterised one
- an attribute in both `RequiresAll` and `RequiresNone`
- `Count > 1` together with suppression (§4.2)

---

## 4. Awarding

### 4.1 Additive by default

A matched combo pays **on top of** core's flat catalogue: a no-scope headshot scores
`kill + headshot + noscope + combo.noscope_hs`. The configured number is a
bonus, not a total — an operator prices a combo knowing the components have already paid.

### 4.2 Suppression

One global switch:

```jsonc
"SuppressCoreAwards": true
```

On a kill where a combo matched, core awards nothing for that kill and the combo's value is
the whole award. Where no combo matched, core behaves exactly as always — otherwise an
ordinary kill would pay nothing.

Global rather than per-combo: one rule an operator can hold in their head beats a per-combo
flag whose effect depends on which combo happened to win §3.2.

**`Count > 1` combos cannot suppress.** The arbiter is called per kill, so on a three-kill
combo the module cannot know during kills one and two that a third is coming; it can only
claim on the third, by which point core has already paid for the first two. Suppressing
only the last would produce "two kills paid, one suppressed, plus the combo" — a number no
operator would predict. Configuring both is a load-time error.

Suppression is scoped deliberately:

| | Suppressed? |
|---|---|
| `kill`, attribute awards, weapon class | yes |
| Killstreak | **no** — a streak is a property of the round, not of this kill |
| `kills` / `deaths` / `assists` counters | **never** |

That last row is FR-PTS-03: points are a judgement, counters are facts. The gates that
do reach a counter are `WarmupPoints` and `BotsEnabled`, and they do so by dropping
the death before this module is consulted at all — for everyone.

---

## 5. What it needs from core

Suppression cannot be implemented from outside core. Core awards the kill in its own
handler; a module hooking `player_death` separately cannot stop that, and plugin ordering
is not guaranteed. Core must ask before it awards.

```csharp
public sealed record RanksKillContext(
    ulong AttackerSteamId, ulong? VictimSteamId, bool VictimIsBot, bool FriendlyFire,
    string Weapon, float Distance, int HitGroup, IReadOnlySet<string> Attributes);

public sealed record RanksKillClaim(
    string Reason, int Points, string? DisplayText = null, bool SuppressCoreAwards = false);

public interface IRanksKillArbiter { RanksKillClaim? ClaimKill(RanksKillContext context); }

// IRanksApi
void SetKillArbiter(IRanksKillArbiter? arbiter);
```

**Flag-shaped facts arrive in `Attributes`; valued ones stay as fields.** An arbiter matching
"past 2000 units" or "hitgroup 5" needs the number, and core cannot pre-expand a set entry
for every threshold an operator might configure — so `Weapon`, `Distance` and `HitGroup`
travel as values and the comparison happens module-side.

Core calls the arbiter inside its kill award path with the attribute set it already
computed. A returned claim is awarded **through core's own pipeline**, which is the point of
this shape rather than a plain `AddPoints` call:

| Comes free from core | Would otherwise be reimplemented here |
|---|---|
| `MinPlayers`, `WarmupPoints`, `BotsEnabled`, `FfaMode` | all four, from `GetPointSettings` |
| VIP multiplier and flags | `VipMultiplier`, `VipFlags` |
| Single away-from-zero rounding | the whole rounding rule |
| `Points.ShowPointMessages` **and** the per-player `!togglepointmsg` preference | impossible — the per-player flag is not on `IRanksApi` |
| `RoundEndSummary` batching | impossible — the buffer is core-internal |

The last two are why the module must not print its own chat line: it would spam players who
switched point messages off, and bypass round-end batching.

One arbiter at a time, the same operator constraint as the absolute rating module
(FR-PTS-00).

### 5.1 Why the reason is not the message

`reason` is not display-only — it is written to the detail log and carried on
`RaisePointsChanged`, which other modules subscribe to. Translated prose there would make a
module-facing identity change with the server's language, so the reason stays `combo.<key>`
and `DisplayText` carries the text.

### 5.2 Attributes come from core

The module does not read `player_death` itself. Core computes the flag set once and hands it
over, so there is one implementation of `penetrated > 0` rather than two free to drift.

The valued comparisons are the other way round — core ships `Weapon`, `Distance` and
`HitGroup` raw and the module compares them, because the thresholds live in this module's
config and core has no way to know them.

---

## 6. Messages

Each combo resolves a translation key, defaulting to `combo.<key>`; an explicit `Message`
overrides it when two combos should share wording.

Because combos are operator-defined, **a missing translation is the normal case**, not an
edge case — and SwiftlyS2's localizer answers a miss with `{lang}.{key}`, so a forgotten key
puts `en.combo.noscope_hs` in chat. A miss falls back to the bare combo key: ugly, but
readable.

Resolution uses the **server** localizer, matching core — `ReportPoints` uses
`_core.Localizer`, not the per-player one, so per-player combo text would be the only
message on the server that differs between viewers.

---

## 7. Table and command

`ranks_combos`, named through `IRanksApi.ResolveTableName` so it inherits core's prefix and
suffix, migrated through `RegisterMigrations` (FR-API-06).

| Column | Type | |
|---|---|---|
| `steam_id` | BIGINT | PK with `combo_key` |
| `combo_key` | varchar(64) | PK with `steam_id` |
| `count` | INT | |
| `last_at` | DATETIME | |

Tall rather than a column per combo: combos are operator-defined, so a wide table cannot
have a column for a key that does not exist yet.

Counts accumulate in memory and flush on a timer, on map change and on unload — `ClaimKill`
runs inside core's award path and must never touch the database there. Same Collector/Writer
split `Ranks_WeaponStats` already uses.

There is deliberately **no flush on disconnect**, unlike WeaponStats. Its session stats live
in a per-player slot that is cleared on disconnect, so the delta has to be taken first;
these counts are keyed by SteamID in a plain map and simply wait for the next tick of the
timer.

**A combo counts whenever it matches, including when a gate refused the points** — FR-PTS-03
again. The exceptions are `BotsEnabled` and `WarmupPoints`: with either off, core discards the
matching death and never consults the arbiter, so there is nothing to count.

`!combos`, alias `!mycombos`, name and permission configurable in `commands.jsonc` like
core's. Lists the caller's combos and counts, ordered by count.

---

## 8. Published API

`Ranks.CustomCombos.Api.v1`, shipped as `Ranks_CustomCombos.Contract.dll` from this module's
own `resources/exports/` — the module owns the contract, so nothing else is guaranteed to be
installed to ship it.

```csharp
public sealed record ComboStatRow(string ComboKey, long Count, DateTime LastAt);

public interface ICustomCombosApi
{
    const string InterfaceKey = "Ranks.CustomCombos.Api.v1";

    Task<IReadOnlyList<ComboStatRow>> GetCombosAsync(ulong steamId);
    Task<ComboStatRow?> GetComboAsync(ulong steamId, string comboKey);
    IReadOnlyList<string> ConfiguredCombos { get; }
}
```

The async pair merges stored rows with the caller's **unflushed** counts, so a figure read
here matches what `!combos` prints rather than lagging a flush interval behind. The peek
hops to the game thread and copies, because the counter map belongs to that thread and a
consumer calls from wherever it likes; a failed peek degrades to stored-only rather than
failing the query.

`ConfiguredCombos` is synchronous because it reads the loaded rule set rather than the
database. It is the only way to render a combo an operator has configured but nobody has
landed — no counter row exists for those. It returns **resolution order** (most specific
first), not config order.

Combo keys are operator-defined, so the set is server-specific: a consumer must treat an
unfamiliar key as ordinary data rather than an error.

Unlike the Ranks API this is named without JIT isolation, which is correct: a provider hard‑
requires the assembly it publishes from, exactly as core does with `Ranks.Contract`.

## 9. Changed from the original specification

FR-MOD-06 has been updated to match everything below, so the two no longer disagree.
Kept here as the record of what moved and why.

| # | Originally | Now | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | No `Suppresses` field; additive only (Q10) | Global `SuppressCoreAwards` | The objection — "core has already awarded with multipliers applied, so the module cannot compute an exact offset" — assumed the module sees the kill *after* core. FR-API-11 inverts that, so nothing is retracted. **Cost: with it on, the module is no longer purely additive and gains an ordering dependency on core.** |
| 2 | `through_smoke`, `attacker_blind`, `attacker_airborne`, `wallbang`, `domination` | raw field names | Checkable against an event dump rather than against a table in this document |
| 3 | `Within` in seconds | dropped; `Count` is same-tick | Core owns streaks and timed multi-kills, leaving same-tick as the only window, and a field with one legal value is noise |
| 4 | Per-combo counters optional | required, and readable through a published API (§8) | Nothing else reads the data otherwise |
| 5 | `!combostats` | `!combos` / `!mycombos` | — |
| 6 | `long_distance` + module `LongDistanceUnits` | `distance:<units>` | Two combos wanting different thresholds is ordinary; one module-wide value cannot express it |

Deviation 3 leaves a gap neither core nor this module fills: a streak **restricted to a
weapon or placement** and spread over a round. Core's streaks are weapon-agnostic and
`Count` here is same-tick. FR-PTS-07 records it.

---

## 10. What it deliberately does not do

**Streaks and timed multi-kills.** Core's, and standard there.

**Anything spanning more than one tick.** No "plant and defuse the same round".

**Guard against double scoring.** Running this with `SuppressCoreAwards` alongside an
absolute rating module such as `Ranks_EloPoints` means two authorities deciding the same
number. The module does not detect it; the README carries the warning.
