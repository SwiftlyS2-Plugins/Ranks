## [1.1.2] - 2026-11-09

- Added Ukrainian translations.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-11-08

- Added Finnish translations.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-06

Requires Ranks 1.1.0.

- Prestige levels restart with each season when core's `Database.VirtualPurgeDays` is set:
  the level follows the season's points, and past seasons are kept in core's history.
- The prestige prefix and the rank icon now update the moment `!resetrank` or `!resetmyrank`
  wipes a player. Before, a reset player kept their old prestige until they scored a point.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-11-04

- Publishes a read API, `Ranks.Prestige.Api.v1`, with each player's prestige level and the
  points to the next one. The module now ships `Ranks_Prestige.Contract.dll` in
  `resources/exports`; install it with the plugin.
- Renaming or removing an alias in `commands.jsonc` now takes effect: the shipped
  `!myprestige` used to stay registered next to whatever replaced it.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-26

First release. Prestige levels shown as a virtual deduction, with the player's real points
left untouched.

- Crossing a level's `MinimumPoints` restarts the visible ladder at zero, while stored
  points, stats and `!top` keep the true total.
- The rank icon and the clan tag follow the displayed total, so a prestiged player drops
  back to the bottom tier instead of keeping a top-tier icon beside a reset number.
- `TagPrefix` adds a prestige marker to core's clan tag, composed by core — the module never
  writes the tag itself and so never flickers against it.
- A level can switch the scoreboard mode (`Premier`, `Competitive`, `Wingman`,
  `Custom`), so later prestiges can look different from earlier ones.
- The display updates on every points change rather than on a timer.
- `!prestige` (alias `!myprestige`) reports the current level and the points to the next,
  as a menu that is also listed under core's `!rank` → Statistics.
- No database and no migration: the level is derived from points core already stores.
