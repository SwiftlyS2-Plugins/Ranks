/// <summary>The only file in this plugin that names a <c>Ranks.Contract</c> type.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This is the one mistake that takes the <b>whole server</b> down rather than just this module.
/// The CLR resolves every type a method <em>names</em> when it JITs that method, so on a box
/// without Ranks a field typed <see cref="IRanksApi"/> is enough to throw FileNotFoundException —
/// at the <em>caller's</em> frame, where this plugin's own try/catch cannot see it — and SwiftlyS2
/// then reports "Hosting failed to start" for every plugin installed.
///
/// So every member that touches a contract type is <c>[MethodImpl(NoInlining)]</c>, and everywhere
/// else reads <see cref="IsAvailable"/> or one of the flattened records below. Returning a
/// <c>RanksPlayerSnapshot</c> or <c>RanksPointSettings</c> would put a contract type in a
/// signature outside this file, which is the same hazard one indirection further out.
///
/// Audit rule: grep the <em>field name</em> across the whole plugin, not the type name.
/// <c>_api.PlayersPurged -= handler</c> in Unload is the classic survivor.
