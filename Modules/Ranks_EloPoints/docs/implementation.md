# Ranks_EloPoints — implementation

Where `Ranks_WeaponStats` is the floor case for a **table-owning** module, this
is the floor case for an **absolute scoring** module: it replaces core's scoring
entirely, reads core's counters as inputs, and writes the only number that
reaches the ladder. If the shape below is awkward, the FR-PTS-00 contract is
wrong — not this module.

`Ranks_EloPoints` — underscore, in the folder, the project and the
`[PluginMetadata] Id`. Core derives the migration ledger from that id.

**`EloMath` names no SwiftlyS2 type and no contract type.** Everything it needs
arrives as `double`, `int` and arrays, so the formula can be read and reasoned
about without the framework in the way.

---

## 2. Lifecycle

### 2.1 ⚠️ Contract isolation comes first

Identical to `Ranks_WeaponStats`, and for the same reason: per implementation
guide §10.2 the CLR resolves every type a method *names* when it JITs that
method, so on a box without `Ranks` a field typed `IRanksApi?` throws
`FileNotFoundException` at the **caller's** frame, and SwiftlyS2 reports
`Hosting failed to start` for every plugin installed.

Exactly one file — `Api/RanksBridge.cs` — names a contract type, every member
touching one is `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]`, and the field is
`object?`:

```csharp
internal sealed class RanksBridge
{
    private object? _api;                       // deliberately not IRanksApi
    private object? _module;
    public bool IsAvailable { get; private set; }

    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
    public bool TryAcquire(IInterfaceManager interfaceManager) { /* ... */ }

    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
    public void Unwire() { }
}
```

This module needs **more** through the bridge than WeaponStats does, and each
accessor is a separate `NoInlining` member returning a primitive or a plain
record:

```csharp
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
public int? GetPoints(ulong steamId) => _api is IRanksApi a ? a.GetPoints(steamId) : null;

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
public void SetPoints(ulong steamId, int points, string reason) =>
    (_api as IRanksApi)?.SetPoints(steamId, points, reason);

// Flattened deliberately: returning RanksPlayerSnapshot would name a contract
// type in the caller's signature and defeat the isolation.
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
public PerfCounters? GetCounters(ulong steamId)
{
    if (_api is not IRanksApi a || a.GetSnapshot(steamId) is not { } s) return null;
    return new PerfCounters(s.Kills, s.Deaths, s.Assists, s.RoundWins, s.BombsPlanted, s.BombsDefused);
}

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
public CoreSettings? GetSettings() =>
    _api is IRanksApi a && a.GetPointSettings() is { } p
        ? new CoreSettings(p.UseCoreRankingLogic, p.StartPoints, p.MinPoints, p.MinPlayers, p.WarmupPoints, p.BotsEnabled)
        : null;
```

`PerfCounters` and `CoreSettings` are module-owned records. **Returning
`RanksPlayerSnapshot` or `RanksPointSettings` directly would put a contract type
in a signature outside the bridge**, which is the same JIT hazard one indirection
further out — and it is the exact mistake the `object?` field is there to
prevent.

**Audit rule:** grep the *field name* (`_api`, `_module`) across the whole
plugin, not the type name.

### 2.2 Where things go

| Step | Work |
|---|---|
| Constructor | nothing |
| `Load` | config, `Core.Registrator.Register(_tracker)`, core-event subscriptions |
| `UseSharedInterface` / `OnSharedInterfaceInjected` | acquire through the bridge; `RegisterMigrations(assembly)` |
| `OnCoreReady` | resolve the table name, read core's settings, run the `UseCoreRankingLogic` check |
| `OnAllPluginsLoaded` | if `Ranks` is absent, log one ungated warning and stay idle |
| `Unload` | settle any open match, then unwire |

`RegisterMigrations` goes in the handshake, not `Load` — there is no API in
`Load` (guide §10.5). Core dedupes on `(assembly, pluginId)`, so the handshake
re-running on every other plugin's load is harmless.

Table names are resolved in `OnCoreReady` for the same reason.

### 2.3 Handlers outside the plugin class must be registered

`MatchTracker` holds the `[GameEventHandler]` methods, so it is invisible to the
framework until:

```csharp
Core.Registrator.Register(_tracker);   // exactly once
```

Registering twice double-counts every round. Signatures must match the expected
delegate exactly or the method is silently skipped.

### 2.3a ⚠️ No native access inside an event dispatch

**Never touch native entity accessors synchronously from inside a game-event
handler, even in `Post` mode.** CS2 can be mid entity-shuffle, and a managed
`try/catch` does **not** catch the resulting access violation — it bypasses the
CLR straight to the crash reporter, taking the host down.

So `OnRoundEnd` reads only `e.Winner` and defers; `OnWinPanelMatch` defers
outright:

```csharp
public HookResult OnRoundEnd(EventRoundEnd e)
{
    var winner = (int)e.Winner;
    _core.Scheduler.NextTick(() => AccrueRound(winner));
    return HookResult.Continue;
}
```

`OnPlayerTeam` is the deliberate exception: its only native read is the named
player's own SteamID, whose pointer is stable for the event that names them, and
deferring risks them being gone by the next tick.

Two further rules follow from the same hazard:

- Guard with `player.IsValid` **and** `player.Controller is { IsValid: true }`.
  A non-null controller wrapper can sit over a dead pointer, and reading a field
  through it faults.
- The match-end watchdog uses `DelayAndRepeatBySeconds(5, 5, …)`, not
  `RepeatBySeconds`. The latter fires its first callback on the *next* scheduler
  tick, which lands inside CS2's map-load shuffle — and that callback reads game
  state.

### 2.4 The `UseCoreRankingLogic` check

```csharp
protected override void OnCoreReady()
{
    if (_bridge.GetSettings() is { UseCoreRankingLogic: true })
        _logger.LogWarning(
            "Ranks_EloPoints: core's Rank.UseCoreRankingLogic is true, so core is still awarding " +
            "points per kill while this module writes a rating over the top. Neither number is " +
            "meaningful. Set Rank.UseCoreRankingLogic to false in core's config.jsonc.");
}
```

Ungated by `DetailedLogging` — it fires once, and it is the only signal between
a misconfigured server and a ladder full of nonsense. It **warns rather than
overriding**: core's config belongs to the operator, and silently flipping it
would be the worse surprise. Same call `Ranks_WeaponStats` makes on its FFA
mismatch.

### 2.5 Hot reload

`Load(hotReload: true)` runs mid-match with players connected. **Any match in
progress is abandoned, not adopted** — the per-round accrual it would need was
never recorded, and reconstructing it from the scoreline would mean inventing
the per-round expectations. A fresh match session starts at the next round, and
the partial one pays nobody.

That is the same rule as a map change (features.md §2.1), reached a different
way.

---

## 3. Configuration

```csharp
Core.Configuration
    .InitializeJsonWithModel<EloConfig>("config.jsonc", "EloPoints", true)
    .Configure(builder =>
        builder.AddJsonFile(Core.Configuration.GetConfigPath("config.jsonc"), optional: false, reloadOnChange: true));

_config = BindConfig();

_reload = ChangeToken.OnChange(Core.Configuration.Manager.GetReloadToken, () =>
{
    var incoming = BindConfig();

    _config = incoming;
    _tracker?.UpdateConfig(incoming);
});
```

Bound off `Core.Configuration.Manager` — the root the framework already owns and
watches. No `ServiceCollection`, no `IOptionsMonitor` (guide §3).

Validation clamps rather than throwing:

| Key | Rule |
|---|---|
| `Rating.Mode` | `Classic` or `RoundAccumulation`; anything else falls back to `RoundAccumulation` with a warning |
| `Rating.K` | `1..200` |
| `Rating.PerformanceBonus` | `0..100`; `0` disables the bonus |
| `Rating.ConfidenceRounds` | `0..100`; `0` disables shrinkage |
| `Rating.ExpectedRounds` | `1..200` |
| `Abandon.Penalty` | `>= 0`; `0` disables |

**`Mode` falls back loudly.** An unrecognised string binding to
`default(RatingMode)` would silently pick whichever member is zero, and the
operator's typo would look like working software.

### 3.1 Settings read from core, not configured here

`StartPoints`, `MinPoints`, `MinPlayers`, `WarmupPoints` and `BotsEnabled`
come from `GetPointSettings()` on every match settle, never cached at load —
`GetPointSettings` returns a fresh snapshot per call precisely so it tracks live
reloads (FR-API-05).

This is FR-MOD-05 rule 3: core applies none of them with `UseCoreRankingLogic`
off, but they are the operator's stated intent and asking them to set the same
thing twice is how the two copies drift.

---

## 4. Database

### 4.1 Migration

```csharp
[Migration(20261026120000)]
public sealed class M202610261200_Rating : Migration
{
    public override void Up() =>
        Create.Table("ranks_elopoints")
            .WithColumn("steam_id").AsInt64().NotNullable().PrimaryKey()
            .WithColumn("rating").AsDecimal(10, 4).NotNullable()
            .WithColumn("matches").AsInt32().NotNullable().WithDefaultValue(0)
            .WithColumn("abandons").AsInt32().NotNullable().WithDefaultValue(0)
            .WithColumn("updated_at").AsDateTime().NotNullable();

    public override void Down() => Delete.Table("ranks_elopoints");
}
```

The same four rules as WeaponStats §4.1 apply: the base name carries the
`ranks_` namespace so FR-DB-03's resolver only adds the operator's affixes; the
PK is declared inline because MySQL names every primary key `PRIMARY` and a
`Constraint(...).Exists()` guard is therefore always false; migration ids are
unique within this assembly only, since the module has its own ledger; and no
`Execute.Sql`, which has no expression tree for core to rewrite.

**`DECIMAL(10,4)`, not `FLOAT`.** Binary floating point makes the stored value
depend on accumulation order, so two servers writing the same sequence of deltas
can disagree in the last digits — and the value is then compared and rounded for
display. Four decimal places is more than the formula needs and costs nothing.

### 4.2 The upsert is absolute, not additive

The opposite of `Ranks_WeaponStats`, and for a reason worth stating: that module
holds session *deltas* with no read on connect, so additive is correct there.
This module reads the current rating, computes a new one, and writes it.

```sql
-- MySQL / MariaDB
INSERT INTO {t} (steam_id, rating, matches, abandons, updated_at)
VALUES (@SteamId, @Rating, 1, @Abandons, @Now)
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
    rating = VALUES(rating),
    matches = matches + 1,
    abandons = abandons + VALUES(abandons),
    updated_at = VALUES(updated_at);

-- PostgreSQL / SQLite
INSERT INTO {t} (...) VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (steam_id) DO UPDATE SET
    rating = EXCLUDED.rating,
    matches = {t}.matches + 1,
    abandons = {t}.abandons + EXCLUDED.abandons,
    updated_at = EXCLUDED.updated_at;
```

`rating` is replaced; the two counters accumulate. Keep `VALUES()` on the MySQL
branch — 8.0.20 deprecates it for the `AS new` alias, which MariaDB does not
support at all.

Table names come from `ResolveTableName` at query-build time, never string
concatenation.

### 4.3 Reading the rating in

A player's rating is needed the moment they enter a match, which may be before
they have a row. Resolution order:

1. this module's table, read once per player per session and cached on the
   session;
2. core's `GetPoints` — covers a server migrating from core scoring, where the
   accumulated points are the only starting signal there is;
3. `Rank.StartPoints`.

The read is off-thread and must not block a round boundary. A read still in
flight when a round ends leaves the session unresolved, and an unresolved player
is simply left out of the team average rather than averaged in at a guessed
value. That is deliberate rather than tolerated: a blocking read on the game
thread is a stall, and one round of a slightly narrower average is invisible
after shrinkage.

**The continuation marshals back through `Core.Scheduler.NextTick` before it
touches anything.** The session, core's API and the session registry are all
game-thread state, and the `await` resumes on the thread pool — applying the
result inline would race the round handler and could publish `RatingResolved`
ahead of `Rating`.

### 4.4 Failure handling

A failed write must not lose the rating. The store retries off-thread and merges
the failed batch back into its own buffer, never into a live session — those
belong to the game thread (§6).

Log at `Error` with the exception object. This is a data-loss path and is not
gated behind `DetailedLogging`.

---

## 5. The match state machine

### 5.1 Reading match state safely

```csharp
// GameRules only exists after world spawn; reading MatchData between maps, during
// bootup, or once the rules entity has been torn down throws — and some SwiftlyS2
// builds throw NullReferenceException rather than anything specific.
private bool TryReadMatch(out MatchSnapshot snapshot)
{
    try
    {
        ref var m = ref Core.Game.MatchData;
        snapshot = new MatchSnapshot(m.ActualRoundsPlayed, m.Phase, m.CTScoreTotal, m.TerroristScoreTotal);
        return true;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogDebug(ex, "MatchData unavailable.");
        snapshot = default;
        return false;
    }
}
```

**The broad catch is not defensive padding — it is a production finding** from
`rampage-plugins-ServerReporter`, which reads the same struct on a heartbeat and
carries the identical comment. It matters more here than there: this module
reads at round end and map unload, which is precisely when the rules entity is
being torn down.

A failed read at a round boundary skips that round's accrual rather than
guessing. A failed read at settle time falls back to the session's own round
count.

### 5.2 Boundaries

| Boundary | Signal |
|---|---|
| match start | first live round after `Phase` leaves `GAMEPHASE_WARMUP_ROUND`, or `ActualRoundsPlayed` moving backwards |
| round end | `EventRoundEnd`, filtered by phase |
| match end | `EventCsWinPanelMatch`, **or** `Phase == GAMEPHASE_MATCH_ENDED` |
| abandoned | `OnMapUnload`, or `Unload`, with a match still open |

Match end is deliberately double-sourced. The event is primary; the phase poll
is a backstop, and settling is idempotent per match so firing both is harmless.
The failure it guards is that *nothing is ever written for any match*, which is
the one outcome that must not be silent.

Warmup rounds are filtered on `Phase == GAMEPHASE_WARMUP_ROUND` and gated by
core's `Rank.WarmupPoints`. The phase is a direct signal, so this does not
depend on inferring warmup from the round counter.

### 5.3 Restart detection

```csharp
// Source-agnostic: a knife-round plugin, an admin, or a match plugin all look
// identical from here, and none of them has to be hooked.
if (snapshot.RoundsPlayed < _lastRoundsPlayed) DiscardMatch("restart");

_lastRoundsPlayed = snapshot.RoundsPlayed;
```

> **Confirmed on a live server (2026-10-26): `ActualRoundsPlayed` resets on
> `mp_restartgame`.** The branch above is the whole of restart detection, and a
> knife round is discarded rather than counted.

Still not covered: a knife round followed by `mp_swapteams` and a continue, with
no restart at all. That counts one phantom round, accepted deliberately — one
round in ~24, which shrinkage renders negligible.

`Nm` comes from `ActualRoundsPlayed` at settle time. Mid-match — for a
participation factor that needs a denominator before the match is over — it
comes from the `mp_maxrounds` convar, falling back to `Rating.ExpectedRounds`
only when the convar cannot be read.

---

## 6. Round accumulation

### 6.1 The session

```csharp
private readonly Dictionary<ulong, MatchSession> _sessions = new();
```

**A dictionary keyed on SteamID, not the 64-slot array WeaponStats uses.** The
slot array is faster, and it is wrong here: a session must survive a disconnect
so a reconnect resumes it (features.md §2.2), and the slot is cleared and
reissued on disconnect. The access rate justifies it — once per player per round
rather than once per bullet.

```csharp
internal sealed class MatchSession
{
    public required ulong SteamId { get; init; }
    public double Rating;            // resolved per §4.3
    public bool RatingResolved;
    public int RoundsPresent;
    public double SumActual;         // Σ S_r
    public double SumExpected;       // Σ E_r
    public PerfCounters? StartCounters;
    public int LastTeam;             // so a departed player can still be attributed at settle
    public bool Present = true;      // false once disconnected or moved to spectator
}
```

All of it is touched only on the game thread. A match boundary resets each
session in place rather than clearing the dictionary — see §6.3.

### 6.3 Resetting between matches

**Clearing `_sessions` at a match boundary is wrong, and it looks right.**
Nothing re-adds a session for an already-connected player: `Adopt` runs on
connect and on hot reload only. So wiping the dictionary after a knife-round
restart, or after any settle, leaves every connected player sessionless, and the
entire following match accrues nothing and settles nobody.

`StartFreshMatch()` instead walks the existing sessions and:

- drops the ones marked absent (they have just been settled or have left);
- zeroes `RoundsPresent`, `SumActual`, `SumExpected`, `LastTeam`;
- keeps `Rating` / `RatingResolved`, so no database re-read is needed;
- **re-captures `StartCounters`.**

That last point is a second bug in the same place. `StartCounters` is a *match*
baseline, and it is first taken on `PlayerDataLoaded` — i.e. at connect. Left
alone, a player's second match would be scored on counters spanning both, and
the performance percentile would be meaningless for everyone who stayed.

It deliberately does not touch `_settled`: `Settle` sets that flag and calls
`StartFreshMatch`, so resetting it there would let the 5-second backstop settle
the same match repeatedly. `_settled` is cleared by the first accrued round of
the next match instead.

### 6.2 Per round

```csharp
[GameEventHandler(HookMode.Post)]
public HookResult OnRoundEnd(EventRoundEnd e)
{
    if (!TryReadMatch(out var m)) return HookResult.Continue;
    if (m.Phase == GamePhase.GAMEPHASE_WARMUP_ROUND && !_core.WarmupPoints) return HookResult.Continue;
    if (m.RoundsPlayed < _lastRoundsPlayed) { DiscardMatch("restart"); return HookResult.Continue; }

    var (avgT, avgCt) = TeamAverages();

    foreach (var player in Core.PlayerManager.GetAllPlayers())
    {
        if (_sessions.GetValueOrDefault(player.SteamID) is not { Present: true } s) continue;

        var own = player.Controller.TeamNum == (int)Team.T ? avgT : avgCt;
        var opp = player.Controller.TeamNum == (int)Team.T ? avgCt : avgT;

        s.SumExpected += EloMath.Expected(own, opp);
        s.SumActual += player.Controller.TeamNum == e.Winner ? 1.0 : 0.0;
        s.RoundsPresent++;
    }

    _lastRoundsPlayed = m.RoundsPlayed;

    return HookResult.Continue;
}
```

**Team averages are recomputed every round**, which is what makes a team that
loses a player mid-match be measured against its current strength. It is a pass
over at most 10 players once per round.

A spectator has no session marked `Present`, so the loop skips them without a
team check.

### 6.3 Imputing bots and unrated players

```csharp
// Order matters: own team, then whole match, then the configured seed. Each
// fallback is only reached when the one above it has no rated player at all.
private double ImputedRating(int teamNum) =>
    MeanRatedOn(teamNum) ?? MeanRatedInMatch() ?? _core.StartPoints;
```

A team with no rated humans makes the match unrated when core's
`Rank.BotsEnabled` is `false` (features.md §3). That check happens once at
settle time, not per round — a team can legitimately have no rated humans for a
few rounds and then gain one.

---

## 7. Settling

### 7.1 Order of operations

Fixed, and each step depends on the one before it:

```
1.  base   = K * (S_adj - E_mean) * (n / Nm)
2.  base   = clamp(base, -K * E_mean, K * (1 - E_mean))     # envelope
3.  delta  = base + B * (percentile - 0.5)                  # bonus
4.  delta  = SignFloor(base, delta)                         # bonus cannot flip base's sign
5.  delta -= Abandon.Penalty                                # only if absent at match end
6.  rating = max(rating + delta, MinPoints)
```

Steps 2 and 4 are both required and neither subsumes the other — features.md
§1.5 has the worked case the envelope misses.

Step 5 is outside the sign floor on purpose: the penalty is not part of the
result, and it is allowed to turn a win into a net loss. That is the entire
point of it.

```csharp
private static double SignFloor(double base_, double delta) => base_ switch
{
    > 0 when delta < Epsilon  => Epsilon,
    < 0 when delta > -Epsilon => -Epsilon,
    _ => delta,
};
```

`Epsilon` is a constant, not a config key — it is a correctness guard, not a
tuning knob.

### 7.2 The performance percentile

```
raw = kills + 0.5*assists - 0.7*deaths + 0.3*roundWins + 2*bombsPlanted + 2*bombsDefused
```

…over the **match delta** of each counter, then ranked within the match and
mapped to `[0, 1]`.

Every counter comes from `GetSnapshot` diffed between match start and match end.
`GetStat` exposes the same numbers but they are lifetime totals, so a long-tenured
player would score higher on their history rather than on this match.

**Mid-match joiners are snapshotted on `PlayerDataLoaded`**, not at match start —
that event is the only moment their record is guaranteed resident. A player whose
start counters were never captured scores at the median (`p = 0.5`), contributing
no bonus either way, rather than being scored against a zero baseline that would
read as a perfect game.

Objectives are weighted in because a pure K/D measure pays players to stop
defusing (features.md §1.4). The coefficients are a starting point and are
expected to move once there is real data; they live in one `const` block for
that reason.

### 7.3 Writing

Settling runs on the game thread. Core is updated inline; the database write is
queued and leaves the thread:

```csharp
_bridge.SetPoints(steamId, (int)Math.Round(updated), "elopoints.match");
_bridge.SavePlayer(steamId);
writes.Add(new RatingWrite(steamId, updated, abandoned));
// ...
_ = _store.CommitAsync(writes);     // off-thread from here on
_sessions.Clear();
```

`SetPoints` has to be inline because core's API is game-thread state; the DB
write must not be, because a synchronous write at match end is a stall.

**The module's table is still the authoritative value** (features.md §5) even
though core is updated first. `CommitAsync` populates the store's cache before
it queues anything, so a player who had already disconnected — and whom core may
no longer track, making `SetPoints` a no-op — is reconciled on their next
`PlayerDataLoaded`:

```csharp
if (_store.TryGetCached(player.SteamId, out var rating) && (int)Math.Round(rating) != player.Points)
    Api.SetPoints(player.SteamId, (int)Math.Round(rating), "elopoints.resync");
```

`SavePlayerAsync` is called explicitly rather than waiting for core's periodic
pass, per FR-MOD-05 rule 5 — the record is evicted once saved, and the next pass
may be minutes away.

**Rounding, never truncation.** `(int)rating` would bias every write downward and
the error would accumulate in one direction forever, which is the whole reason
the `DECIMAL` column exists.

---

## 8. Purge

```csharp
protected override void OnPlayersPurged(IReadOnlyList<ulong> steamIds) => _ = _store.PurgeAsync(steamIds);
```

Core has already removed its own rows by the time this fires, so the module must
not expect to look the player up.

---

## 9. Rating invariants

Nothing asserts these at runtime. Every one of them is **silent when broken** —
the module keeps running and the numbers stay plausible — so check them by reading
whenever `EloMath` changes.

| Invariant | What breaking it looks like |
|---|---|
| `Expected(r, r) == 0.5`; a 400-point gap gives ≈ `0.9091`; `Expected(a,b) + Expected(b,a) == 1` | an inverted sign in the exponent, invisible on even teams |
| Shrinkage with `n = 0` yields `S_adj == E`, giving zero delta | a division that produces `NaN` on an empty session |
| Shrinkage is monotonic in `n` toward the unshrunk value | an inverted weighting that damps *long* sessions instead of short ones |
| 13-0 even teams, `c = 10` → `+14.13`; full 13-8 → `+4.03`; join-at-18 4-0 → `+1.36`; 2-round cameo → `+0.40` | coefficient drift away from the figures published in features.md |
| A double-counted accrual (`S̄ = 2.0`) still respects the envelope ceiling | the envelope clamp removed or mis-bounded |
| `E = 0.95`, win, worst percentile → delta is positive | the sign floor missing, which the envelope does not catch |
| Abandon penalty always reduces the delta by exactly `Penalty` | the penalty folded inside the sign floor |
| Four identical performances all land on the median | ties not sharing a rank, ordering identical play arbitrarily |

> **The envelope invariant only shows up on corrupted input.** With an actual
> score in `[0, 1]`, `K(S_adj − E)` already lands inside the envelope
> algebraically, so the clamp is unreachable on valid data. It exists to bound an
> upstream accrual bug — a round credited twice. Deleting it passed a 20 000
> iteration randomised sweep, which is why reading beats sampling here.

| Item | Blocking? | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `EventCsWinPanelMatch` firing on every match configuration | no | phase backstop covers it (§5.2) |
| Performance coefficients (§7.2) | no | starting values; expected to move on real data |
| Placement matches | no | deliberately out of scope (features.md §6) |
| `Abandon.Penalty` does not deter abandonment in the first third of a lopsided match | no | bounded and documented (features.md §2.3); closing it needs `Penalty ≈ K × 0.9` |
