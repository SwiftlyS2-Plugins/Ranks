## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-26

First release. Faceit-style Elo rating in place of core's per-kill scoring.

- Rating is settled once per match from the result, not per kill. Set
  `Rank.UseCoreRankingLogic` to `false` so this module owns scoring.
- Shrinkage keeps a short session from counting as a full result, and a performance bonus
  rewards carrying a losing team.
- Abandoning a match applies a configurable penalty.
- Published `Ranks.EloPoints.Api.v1` for standings, the leaderboard and whether a rated
  match is in progress.
