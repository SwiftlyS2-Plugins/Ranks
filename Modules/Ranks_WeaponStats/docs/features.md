# Ranks_WeaponStats — features

> **Status:** design. Features and the core surface this module touches.
> Implementation lands once the shared API is settled.
> Specified by [FR-MOD-01](../../../docs/functional-requirements.md).

Per-weapon and per-hitbox tracking. The module owns its data end to end: its own
tables, its own commands, its own config. Core's menu does not list it
(FR-CMD-04).

**It awards no points.** It is a statistics module, not a scoring one — nothing
here calls `AddPoints`, and core's ladder is unaffected by whether it is
installed.

---

## 1. What it tracks

### Per weapon, per player

| Counter | Source |
|---|---|
| Shots fired | `weapon_fire` |
| Hits | `player_hurt` (as attacker) |
| Damage dealt | `player_hurt.ActualDmgHealth` |
| Kills | `player_death` (as attacker) |
| Deaths | `player_death` (as victim) |
| Headshots | `player_death.Headshot` |

**Health damage only.** `player_hurt` also carries `ActualDmgArmor`; it is not
recorded and no column exists for it. Armour absorbed is not damage done, and
including it would make the figure disagree with CS2's own ADR.

### 1.1 What is excluded

**Everything recorded is the attacker's own work.** Three things are not counted
at all — not bucketed, not stored:

| Excluded | Configurable | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Friendly fire — hits, damage, hitgroups, **and kills** | **`Tracking.CountFriendlyFire`**, default `false` | not combat performance on a team server; but on FFA every kill looks like friendly fire, so the operator decides |
| Self damage — own grenade, own molotov | **no** | attacker and victim are the same player; never performance, in any mode |
| Anything on the victim's side — hitgroups taken, damage endured | **no** | the module answers "how do I shoot", not "how am I shot" |

**Deaths are the deliberate exception to the friendly-fire switch** and are never
filtered by it. Being killed by a teammate or by the world is still a death, and
`ranks_players.deaths` counts every non-bot death (FR-DB-04), so dropping any
source would break the reconciliation below.

**Kills follow the switch, and that mirrors core.** With it `false`, a team kill
is excluded here exactly as `team_kill` keeps it out of
`ranks_players.kills`. Counting the kill while excluding the hits that produced
it would be incoherent, and counting it on a team server makes a kills
leaderboard farmable.

> [!WARNING]
> **The switch must match the game mode, and the failure is silent.** Left
> `false` on an FFA server, where everyone shares a team, the module records
> almost nothing — which reads as a broken plugin, not a setting. Core carries
> the same distinction in `Rank.FfaMode`; the module reads it through
> FR-API-05 and **warns once at startup** when core says FFA and this says
> `false`. It warns rather than auto-corrects: an operator may legitimately run
> FFA and still not want friendly fire counted.

**Counters are raw event counts, and the scoring gates that reach them are the bot
and warmup ones.** That is core's rule, not this module inventing a policy: per
FR-PTS-03 `MinPlayers` and FFA suppress the award and never the stat, while
`PointsForBots` and `WarmupPoints` discard the death event outright — a bot is not a
player and a warmup round is not the match, so neither is a fact about play.

The payoff is a **reconciliation invariant** worth testing against:

```
SUM(ranks_weapon_stats.kills)  WHERE steam_id = X  ==  ranks_players.kills  for X
SUM(ranks_weapon_stats.deaths) WHERE steam_id = X  ==  ranks_players.deaths for X
```

**It holds at the shipped defaults on a server without warmup**, because both sides
then count the same events under the same rules — team kills excluded on both (§1.1),
bot interactions excluded on both (`CountAgainstBots` / `CountFromBots` default
`false` to match core's `PointsForBots`), every non-bot death counted on both,
and bots given rows on neither (FR-DB-07).

**Warmup breaks it, and no setting here reconciles it.** Core discards warmup deaths
when `Rank.WarmupPoints` is off; this module has no warmup gate and records them, so
its totals run **high** by exactly the warmup kills. Closing that would mean either a
`Tracking.CountDuringWarmup` switch plus a live warmup signal on the core API
(`GetPointSettings` carries the *setting*, not the current phase), or accepting the
divergence. It is accepted for now.

Three settings also break it, all of them deliberate operator choices:

| Setting | Effect on the invariant |
|---|---|
| `Tracking.CountFriendlyFire = true` | module counts team kills; core never does, so module `kills` runs **high** |
| `Tracking.CountAgainstBots` disagreeing with core's `Rank.PointsForBots` | the two sides count different populations — **high** when this module is the permissive one, **low** when core is |
| `Tracking.CountFromBots` disagreeing with core's `Rank.PointsForBots` | same, on `deaths` |

A **bug** also breaks it, and that is the one to care about: any event the
module drops without being told to. §1.3 exists for exactly that reason.

`headshots` has no counterpart — core's nine counters (FR-DB-04) do not include
one. `headshot` is a priced *event*, not a stored stat, so per-weapon
headshots are new data with nothing to reconcile against.

### 1.2 The two bot switches

The operator can exclude bot interactions along **two independent axes**,
because the events carry two different counterparties:

| Setting | Default | Suppresses |
|---|---|---|
| `Tracking.CountAgainstBots` | `false` | hits, damage, kills, headshots, hitgroups where the **victim** is a bot |
| `Tracking.CountFromBots` | `false` | deaths where the **killer** is a bot |

Either, both or neither. The split is what lets a practice server keep bot kills
while dropping deaths to bots, or the reverse.

**Both default to `false` to match core's `Rank.PointsForBots`**, which also
defaults `false` and gates bot interactions out of core's own counters
(FR-PTS-03). That agreement is the only reason a freshly installed server
reconciles; setting either independently of core's switch is the operator
choosing to break the invariant above — legitimate, but a choice.

Two consequences that are not obvious from the setting names:

- **Shots can never be filtered.** `weapon_fire` carries no victim, so with
  `CountAgainstBots = false` the shots at a bot still count while the hits do
  not, and accuracy reads low. The event does not carry a target, so there is no
  version of this that works.
- **Neither switch affects a bot's own rows.** A bot never has stats of its own
  under any setting — it has no SteamID64 to key them to (FR-DB-07).

### 1.3 Deaths with no weapon to attribute

Falls, world damage and console suicides fire `player_death` with no attacker.
Core increments the victim's `deaths`; this module needs a weapon to file it
under, and has none.

**Those rows are bucketed, never dropped** — dropping them silently breaks the
invariant above, and "my deaths don't add up" is a bug report nobody can
diagnose from the data.

CS2 supplies real values for most of these — `world` for falls and console
kills, `planted_c4` for the bomb — and they are kept as-is, because "died to the
bomb 14 times" is a statistic a player would want. Only a genuinely empty value
falls back to a reserved `unknown` bucket.

### Per hitgroup, per player

**Two counters per hitgroup — hits and health damage** — recorded from the
attacker's side only, keyed on `player_hurt.ActualHitgroup`. "I have landed 412
headshots for 38 000 damage" is the question this table answers.

The victim's side is not recorded: nothing tracks where a player *gets* hit.
That halves the table and matches what the feature is for.

`HitGroup_t` is a typed enum on the event, so no magic numbers — but its values
are **not a dense 0..N range**, and that is the trap:

```
INVALID = -1    GENERIC = 0    HEAD = 1    CHEST = 2    STOMACH = 3
LEFTARM = 4     RIGHTARM = 5   LEFTLEG = 6 RIGHTLEG = 7 NECK = 8
UNUSED  = 9     GEAR = 10      SPECIAL = 11            COUNT = 12
```

Eleven groups are tracked (`GENERIC` through `SPECIAL`), but they occupy values
**0–11 with a hole at 9**. An eleven-element array indexed by the raw value
overflows on `SPECIAL`. `INVALID = -1` is reachable — world damage, falls — and
would index out of bounds the other way. `COUNT = 12` is a sentinel, never a
group.

**CS2 has no "feet" hitgroup.** The legacy LVL Ranks / ExStats column of that
name has no engine equivalent and is not reproduced.

## 2. Game events it hooks

Its own, directly — core does not relay game events.

| Event | Declared in | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `weapon_fire` | `mod.gameevents` **only** | `UserId`, `Weapon`, `Silenced` |
| `player_hurt` | `core` + `mod` | attacker/victim, `Weapon`, `ActualDmgHealth`, `ActualHitgroup` |
| `player_death` | `core` + `mod` | attacker/victim/assister, `Weapon`, `Headshot` |

Two things to carry into implementation:

- **Prefer the `Actual*` properties.** `DmgHealth` is a `short` and `Health` /
  `Armor` / `Hitgroup` are `byte`; the `Actual*` variants are the untruncated
  values. A server granting >255 HP silently corrupts the byte ones.
- **`weapon_fire` is the highest-frequency event in the plugin** — once per
  bullet, so roughly 200/second on a busy 20-player server. It must not touch
  the database (NFR-01), and it should hold itself to the allocation-free bar
  NFR-11 sets for tick callbacks even though it is not one.

> `weapon_fire` is declared in `mod.gameevents` only, not `core.gameevents` —
> the FR-PTS-01 deprecation risk applies. Confirm it still fires before relying
> on shot counts.

## 3. What it needs from core

| Need | Surface | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Shared connection | `ConnectionName` | exists (FR-API-06) |
| Affixed table names | `ResolveTableName(baseName)` | exists (FR-API-06) |
| Schema creation | `RegisterMigrations(assembly, pluginId)` | exists (FR-API-06) |
| Sweep its rows on purge | `PlayersPurged` | exists (FR-API-04) |
| Know when to flush | — | **see §6** |
| Know which thread handlers run on | — | **game thread, guaranteed** (FR-API-04) |

Nothing else. It does not read points, ranks, snapshots or stats from core — it
is a pure producer that happens to share core's database and purge lifecycle.

**That makes it the cleanest test of the floor for a table-owning module:** if
these four members plus a flush signal are enough, the database half of
`RanksModuleBase` is correctly scoped.

---

## 4. Tables

`ranks_weapon_stats` and `ranks_hit_stats`, both affixed via FR-API-06 so they
sit alongside core's, both migrated by core against this module's ledger
(FR-DB-05).

**Each needs a real PK on its natural key** — `(steam_id, weapon)` and
`(steam_id, hitgroup)`. Without one, MySQL's `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` silently
inserts duplicates forever while PostgreSQL and SQLite reject the statement
outright.

Weapon is stored as a name rather than a defindex: the events give a name, and
resolving it to a defindex would add a lookup that earns nothing.

**The stored form is the entity designer name — `weapon_ak47`.** That is what
`entities.json`, the entity system and `weapon_fire` all use, so it is the one
spelling nothing else has to translate. `player_death` reports the short form
(`ak47`) instead, so names are normalised on ingest; stored verbatim, every gun
would get two rows and accuracy would be permanently wrong.

Non-weapon death sources — `world`, `planted_c4`, `inferno`, `trigger_hurt` —
keep their own names, because there is no `weapon_world` entity to point at.

---

## 5. Commands

`!weaponstats` / `!ws`, owned by the module. Names, aliases and permissions come
from the module's own `commands.jsonc`, following core's FR-CMD-01 shape, so the
module registers them at runtime through `Core.Command.RegisterCommand` rather
than by attribute.

**Hitgroup totals have no command.** They are collected, stored in
`ranks_hit_stats` and exposed through `IWeaponStatsApi.GetHitGroupsAsync`, but
nothing prints them in chat — `StatsCommands.RegisterAll` registers only the
`WeaponStats` key.

---

## 6. Timing — the open design question

Counters increment on every shot and every hit, so a write-through design is
impossible: that is hundreds of statements per second. The module accumulates in
memory and flushes periodically.

**It should accumulate *deltas* and write additively** (`counter = counter +
delta`), not load-then-overwrite:

- no read on connect, so a map change costs zero queries instead of 64
- two servers sharing one database cannot clobber each other's counters

This is a deliberate divergence from core, which writes **absolute** values
because its in-memory record is authoritative (FR-DB-06). A module holding only
session deltas has no such claim, and additive is the correct shape for it.

The open part is **what triggers a flush**:

| Moment | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Periodic | bounds data loss on a crash |
| Player disconnect | their session ends; deltas must not be carried |
| Map end | same, in bulk |
| Plugin unload | last chance; the module's own `Unload` covers it |

**Resolved — the module needs nothing from core here.** The obvious move was to
piggyback core's `PlayerDataSaved`, on the reasoning that FR-DB-07 already has
core saving at those moments. That would have been wrong: it couples this
module's write timing to another plugin's save cadence, and it asks core for a
guarantee it has never made.

SwiftlyS2 gives **every** plugin the triggers directly — `OnClientDisconnected`,
`OnMapUnload`, and `ISchedulerService` for the timer. They are also the better
signals: they describe the player's session rather than core's bookkeeping, so
they stay correct if core's save policy ever changes.

## 7. API requests raised

| # | Request | Also wanted by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Documented thread affinity for every core event | every module | **granted** — all events are game-thread (FR-API-04) |
| 2 | `PlayerDataSaved` guaranteed on disconnect and map end | — | **cut** — §6 |

Request 2 is recorded because it was raised and rejected, not because it is
pending. The framework already serves it, and a core member that duplicates a
framework one is a maintenance liability with no consumer.

Request 1 was granted as **documentation of existing behaviour**, not new API
surface — the outcome a module audit should be hoping for.
