# Ranks_WeaponStats

Per-weapon and per-hitbox statistics for the [Ranks](../../README.md) plugin.

---

## Features

- 🔫 **Per-weapon totals** - shots, hits, damage, kills, deaths and headshots for every gun
- 🎯 **Hitbox breakdown** - where your bullets actually land, by hitgroup and per weapon
- 📊 **In-game command** - `!weaponstats`, configurable name and permission
- 🤖 **Bot and friendly-fire switches** - count them or not, per game mode
- 🔌 **Published API** - other plugins read the same totals

**It awards no points and does not affect ranks.** Installing or removing it leaves
core's ladder untouched.

---

## Requirements

- `Ranks` core installed and loaded
- A SwiftlyS2 database connection — the same one core uses, named in **core's**
  `config.jsonc`, not here

The module creates its own tables on that connection and never touches core's.

---

## Installation

1. Drop the module into your plugins directory alongside `Ranks`.
2. Start the server once. Core creates the tables on first load.
3. Check the console for `Ranks_WeaponStats` — a missing `Ranks` is reported there,
   and the module stays idle rather than failing the server.

## Commands

### Player Commands

| Command | Aliases | Permission | Description |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `!weaponstats` | `!ws` | None | Your per-weapon table, best weapon first |

Name, aliases and permission are editable in `commands.jsonc`. An empty `Command`
removes the command. It is module-owned and does not appear in core's `!rank` menu.

> [!NOTE]
> **Hitgroup totals have no command.** They are reachable from the menu — **Overall
> Hit Stats** under `!rank` → Statistics, and per weapon by selecting a row in the
> weapon list — and through `GetHitGroupsAsync` / `GetWeaponHitGroupsAsync` on the
> published API, but nothing prints them in chat.

## Configuration

Config file: `addons/swiftlys2/plugins/Ranks_WeaponStats/config.jsonc`

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `Tracking.CountFriendlyFire` | bool | `false` | Count hits, damage, hitgroups and kills against players on your own team |
| `Database.FlushIntervalSeconds` | int | `120` | How often counters are written; `0` flushes only on disconnect, map change and unload |
| `Display.MinShotsToList` | int | `10` | Hide weapons fired fewer times than this |
| `Display.MinShotsToList` | int | `10` | Hides weapons barely touched, so one stray pistol shot does not fill the table |
| `General.DetailedLogging` | bool | `false` | Narrates expected flow; warnings and errors print regardless |

    }
  }
}
```

### Friendly fire — match this to your game mode

**On a normal team server leave it `false`.** Shooting a teammate is not combat
performance, and counting it lets someone pad damage and accuracy on their own side.

**On an FFA or deathmatch server set it `true`.** Everyone is typically on one team
there, so with it `false` the module sees nearly every kill as friendly fire and
records **almost nothing**. Core has the matching switch in `Rank.FfaMode`; set both
the same way.

> [!NOTE]
> The module warns once at startup if core reports FFA mode while this is still
> `false` — the symptom otherwise looks like a broken plugin rather than a setting.

**Self damage is never counted** under any mode, and **deaths are never filtered by
this switch**: being killed by a teammate is still a death.

### Bots are core's switch, not this module's

This module has **no bot setting**. It reads core's `Rank.BotsEnabled` through the API,
so one flip covers core, this module and every other one — and the totals cannot be
configured into disagreeing.

With it off (the default) an interaction is dropped whenever the counterparty is a bot:
hits, damage, hitgroups, kills and headshots against one, and deaths caused by one.
At the shipped defaults, on a server without warmup, the totals reconcile:

```
SUM(ranks_weapon_stats.kills) per player  ==  ranks_players.kills
SUM(ranks_weapon_stats.hits)  per player  ==  ranks_players.hits
```

Core keeps its own overall `hits`, `misses` and `headshots` on the player row, counted
from the same events and now gated by the same switch.

> [!NOTE]
> **Warmup is the remaining source of divergence.** Core drops warmup deaths entirely
> when its `Rank.WarmupPoints` is off; this module has no warmup switch and records
> them, so its totals run ahead on any server with warmup enabled. There is no setting
> that reconciles the two today.

> [!WARNING]
> **`BotsEnabled = false` makes accuracy read low.** Shots come from `weapon_fire`,
> which has no victim and therefore cannot be filtered — shots at bots count while the
> resulting hits do not. Nothing can fix this; the event carries no target. Turn
> `Rank.BotsEnabled` **on** if you run bots and care about accuracy.

The switch does not affect bots' *own* rows: a bot never gets stats of its own, because
it has no SteamID64 to key them to.

## How It Works

**Overview**

Every shot, hit and death is accumulated in memory per player, then written to the
database in batches.

**Collection**

`weapon_fire` increments shots, `player_hurt` adds hits, damage and the hitgroup, and
`player_death` records kills, headshots and deaths. The tracking switches decide which
of those count; the shot counter is the one that cannot be filtered, since the fire
event names no victim.

**Persistence**

Counters flush on the timer, on disconnect, on map change and on unload. Writes are
**additive** rather than absolute, so two servers sharing one database accumulate
instead of overwriting each other, and nothing has to be read back when a player
connects.

**Reading**

`!weaponstats` and the API both merge the stored rows with the caller's unflushed
session delta, so a figure never lags a flush interval behind what just happened.
`Display.MinShotsToList` shapes the menu only; the API
returns every row.

## For plugin developers

The module publishes `Ranks.WeaponStats.Api.v1`. Reference
`Ranks_WeaponStats.Contract.dll` from this module's `resources/exports/` — **do not
copy it next to your plugin**, or the host loads a second one, the interface gets two
type identities, and binding silently stops matching.

```csharp
public interface IWeaponStatsApi
{
    const string InterfaceKey = "Ranks.WeaponStats.Api.v1";

    Task<IReadOnlyList<WeaponStatRow>> GetWeaponsAsync(ulong steamId);
    Task<IReadOnlyList<HitGroupStatRow>> GetHitGroupsAsync(ulong steamId);
    Task<IReadOnlyList<WeaponHitGroupStatRow>> GetWeaponHitGroupsAsync(ulong steamId);
    Task<WeaponStatRow?> GetWeaponAsync(ulong steamId, string weapon);
}
```

`GetWeaponHitGroupsAsync` is the same distribution split by weapon — summing its rows
over weapons reproduces `GetHitGroupsAsync` exactly.

**Only landed hits appear in either.** A miss has no hitgroup; misses are on the weapon
row (`Misses`) and, overall, on core's `ranks_players.misses`.

`Weapon` is the entity designer name (`weapon_ak47`, not `ak47`); `GetWeaponAsync`
normalises either spelling. `HitGroup` is the raw `HitGroup_t` value, which is not a
dense range — `0` through `11` with a hole at `9`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| "this module is idle" at startup | Ranks is not installed | Install Ranks alongside it |
| Almost nothing is recorded | FFA server with `CountFriendlyFire` off | Set it `true`, and core's `Rank.FfaMode` to match |
| Accuracy looks far too low | Bots on the server with core's `Rank.BotsEnabled` off | Turn `Rank.BotsEnabled` on |
| `!weaponstats` disagrees with `!stats` | Warmup rounds, which core drops and this module keeps | Expected; see the note under the bot switch |
| Stats lost after a crash | Flush interval too long | Lower `Database.FlushIntervalSeconds` |
| No tables created | Core could not reach the database | Check core's connection name and the startup log |
| `!hitstats` does nothing | It does not exist | Hitgroup totals are API-only; see the note under Commands |
