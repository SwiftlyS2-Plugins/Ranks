## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-26

First release. Per-weapon and per-hitbox statistics for the Ranks plugin.

- Tracks shots, hits, misses, damage, kills, deaths and headshots per weapon, plus hits
  and damage per hitgroup — both overall and broken down per weapon.
- `!weaponstats` (alias `!ws`) opens a paged weapon menu; the hitgroup breakdown has a
  screen of its own. Both are also listed under core's `!rank` → Statistics, so a player
  finds them without knowing the command exists.
- `Display.TopWeapons` was dropped: it capped rows in a chat list that no longer exists,
  and the menu pages instead. `Display.MinShotsToList` still hides barely-used weapons.
- Bot interactions are counted only when core's `Rank.BotsEnabled` is on — this module has
  no bot switch of its own, so the two can never be configured into disagreeing.
- Figures include the caller's unflushed session delta, so a reading never lags a flush
  interval behind.
- Published `Ranks.WeaponStats.Api.v1` for other plugins to read the same totals.
